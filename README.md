## Description

MyReaders is a literacy programme started by TeachForMalaysia alumni that is currently adopted and run in select schools in Malaysia. This literacy portal aims to provide an avenue for facilitators of this programme to add and track diagnostic data from the students in the programme.

The portal also has an admin interface, where the programme owners can log in and view diagnostic data across participating schools.

## System Dependencies

1. [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) at least version 9.4

## Getting Started

1. Get the codebase

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/gohdaniel15/myreaders.git
  ```

2. Install gem dependencies

  ```bash
  cd myreaders
  bundle install
  ```

3. Setup environment variables

  You can find the environment variables used in this application in `.env.sample`. We're using [Dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) to load the environment variables.

  ```bash
  cp .env.sample .env
  # Update the values of the environment variables in .env accordingly
  ```

4. Setup Database

  ```bash
  cp config/database.yml.sample config/database.yml
  ```

  ```bash
  rake db:setup
  ```

  To seed the database, simply run

  ```bash
  rake db:seed
  ```

5. Start the application

  We're using [Puma](https://github.com/puma/puma) as our web server.

  ```bash
  # Start the web server
  rails server -b 0.0.0.0
  ```

## Testing

We use [Rspec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails) as our testing framework. So, during development, run these regularly.

```bash
# Run the specs
bundle exec rspec
```

## Coding Style

1. Ruby

	We use [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) to perform static analysis of the code according to rules defined in `.rubocop.yml`. Basically, it follows [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide) and [Rails Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/rails-style-guide).

	```bash
	# Run rubocop
	bundle exec rubocop
	```

2. CoffeeScript

	We setup [CoffeeLint](http://www.coffeelint.org) to ensure our CoffeeScript code are clean and consistent. You may find the installation steps [here](http://www.coffeelint.org/#install).

	```bash
	# Run coffeelint
	coffeelint .
	```

3. Slim - [Slim-Lint](https://github.com/sds/slim-lint)

  ```bash
  # Run slim-lint
  slim-lint .
  ```

4. SCSS - [SCSS-Lint](https://github.com/brigade/scss-lint)

  ```bash
  # Run scss-lint
  scss-lint
  ```

## Branch Policy

We follow the [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) when developing the application, and name our branches as follow:

- `master` is the active development branch

Local development branch naming:

- `feature/<your-branch-name>` for substantial new feature or function
- `enhance/<your-branch-name>` for minor feature or function enhancement
- `bugfix/<your-branch-name>` for bug fixes

## Services

There are a few integrations involved when it comes to staging and production environment. We integrate project's repository on Github with [Circle Ci](https://circleci.com/) and [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/) to build, run and analyze development's code before they are merged to the master branch and automatically deployed to [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/).

1. Error and Performance monitoring

  We use [AppSignal](https://appsignal.com/) to track errors and monitor performance of the application on staging and production environment. The  environment variable `APPSIGNAL_PUSH_API_KEY` need to be set to get it work.

## Deployment

We deploy our application to heroku. Automatic deployment has been setup for our staging environment as documented [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration#automatic-deploys). To manually deploy to heroku with Git, you need to:

1. Register a heroku account and request access to staging and production applications
2. Install [heroku toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) which is a CLI tool for creating and managing Heroku apps
3. Setup heroku remote for staging and production

  ```bash
  # Setup heroku remote for production
  heroku git:remote -a myreaders -r production

  # Setup heroku remote for staging
  heroku git:remote -a myreaders-staging -r staging
  ```
4. Manual deployment with Git

  ```bash
  # Deploy to production with Git
  git push production master

  # Deploy to staging with Git
  git push staging master
  ```
